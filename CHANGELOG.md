# Changelog

## 0.2.2 - 2026-10-09

### New
- Shu has its own icon: 书 (shū, "book"), with its dot drawn as sound waves. On Android it
  follows themed icons, and the playback notification uses it too

## 0.2.1 - 2026-10-08

### Changed
- Shu is now open source, under the GPL-3.0
- The app is now called Shu
- New app ID, io.player.shu. Android installs it as a separate app: add your extensions again
  and remove the old Audiobooks app

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-08

### New
- Home is now built by catalog extensions: rows like "Trending now" and "New releases", and a
  row per genre
- "See all" on every row opens the whole list, loading more as you scroll
- Browse by genre
- Book pages show the narrator, length, rating, series and genres when the extension has them
- Books from a catalog list the versions your source extensions found. Play starts the best one,
  or picks up where you left off with the one you listened to before

### Changed
- Covers that aren't square (most book covers) are shown whole instead of cropped
- Search lists results from catalogs first
- The version you play keeps the catalog's title, cover and narrator in your library

### Fixed
- Extension settings were gone after restarting the app
- Extensions didn't load in a Linux build made from a clean checkout

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-08

First release.

- Install extensions from a link to the `.js` file or to a repository `index.json`
- Search across all installed extensions
- Library that remembers where you stopped in every book
- Chapters, playback speed, sleep timer, 15/30 second skips
- Background playback with lock screen controls on Android, media keys on Linux
- Covers and the last known home screen are cached, so the app opens fast and works with a
  poor connection
